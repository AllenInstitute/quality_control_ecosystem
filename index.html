            The <b>Allen Institute</b> is dedicated to accelerating the
            understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. 
            Using a big science approach, the Allen Institute generates useful 
            public resources used by researchers and organizations around the globe, 
            drives technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental 
            brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory.

        <h1> The Allen Brain Observatory Ecosystem on Github </h1>

        <p> 
            The <b>Allen Brain Observatory</b> presents the first standardized 
            in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the mouse visual 
            cortex. Neural activity is recorded using two different modalities: 
            2-photon optical physiology and Neuropixels probes.  
            We make all the data from our systematic surveys of the mouse visual
            system available to the community for further analysis and 
            exploration. These data provide a rich testbed for theories and models 
            of cortical computation.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            The observatory currently encompasses three broad projects: 
            <ul>
                <li>Visual Coding (complete)</li>
                <li>Visual Behavior (complete)</li>
                <li>Learning mFISH (in development)</li>
            </ul>
        <p> 
            <b>Visual Coding</b> used a broad range of visual stimuli, 
            ranging from gratings and noise stimuli to natural images and 
            movies which the mice passively view. It surveys the spatial and 
            temporal dynamics of visual representation in the mouse 
            corticothalamic visual pathways. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            <b>Visual Behavior</b> mice performed a visual
            change detection task to characterize how sensation and 
            behavior are encoded in activity across the visual cortex 
            and how these representations are influenced by behavior state and expectation. 
            Both the Visual Behavior and Visual Coding projects include 
            2-photon and Neuropixels datasets that have slightly different implementations.
        </p>

        <p> 
            In the <b>Learning mFISH</b> project description
        </p>


        <p>
           To accommodate the different neural recording modalities as
            well as the differences between Visual Coding and Visual Behavior, 
            we have created several different Github repositories to facilitate 
            data exploration and analysis across these different data variations.
