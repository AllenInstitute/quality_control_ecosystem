            The <b>Allen Institute</b> is dedicated to accelerating the
            understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. 
            Using a big science approach, the Allen Institute generates useful 
            public resources used by researchers and organizations around the globe, 
            drives technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental 
            brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory.

        <h1> Brain Observatory Quality Control Ecosystem</h1>
        <h1><img src="images/brainwaves_qc.PNG"style="max-width: 300px"></img></h1>

        <p> 
            The Allen Brain Observatory presents the first standardized 
            in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the mouse visual 
            cortex. A robust quality control system is integral 
            to the success of these projects. Additionally we believe that transparency
            into this process not only builds trust within the broader scientific community
            but facilitates growth of the entire field by promoting discussion and
            providing open source tools for all to utilize. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
          The quality control system is currently supported by several code repos and databases.
          The components of the overall code ecosystem are as follows: 
            <ul>
                <li>Raw & processed data storage</li>
                <li>QC metric computation</li>
                <li>QC metric storage</li>
                <li>QC report building and infrastructure</li>
                <li>QC report display human feedback</li>

            </ul>

        <h2> Raw & Processed Data Storage </h2>

        <p>
          Both raw and processed data are currently stored in an 
          <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/quality_control_ecosystem/wiki/Raw-&-Processed-Data-Storage">
            <b>internal SQL database and network storage system</b></a> known as LIMS (Lab Information Management System).
          Some metrics created by the processing pipeline are directly uploaded to qc storage, while many others are 
          derived using the raw and processed files.
        </p>


        <h2> QC Metric Computation </h2>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/brain_observatory_qc"><b>Brain Observatory QC</b></a>
           (BOQC) repository is a space for internal Allen Institute researchers
          to develop new or one-off quality control metrics and plots. In this space scientists create
          functions that can be run independently for their specific needs.
          It is also a central location for for tracking data quality issues. 
          This is a private repo and is only accessible to internal Allen Institute researchers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/mindscope_qc_metrics"><b>Mindscope QC metrics</b></a>
          is considered the production space for computing quality control metrics that
          can then be displayed in qc reports. All metrics and plots generated from this repo
          are uploaded to the qc metrics database.
          
          Functions from BOQC repo can be moved into this repo once they are stable and abide
          by the code and style guides.

          This is a private repo and is only accessible to internal Allen Institute researchers.

  <h2> QC Report Display </h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/mouseseeks">The <b>MouseSeeks</b> repo</a>
    is responsible for displaying the quality control reports in a webapp that researchers
    use to monitor data quality as well as make and record specific quality control decisions.

    This is a private repo and is only accessible to internal Allen Institute researchers.
